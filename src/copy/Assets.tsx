      para: `Cryptocurrency, a novel financial asset class initiated by Bitcoin's trading debut on Mt. Gox in 2010, has evolved into a sophisticated economic ecosystem. Initially conceptualised as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Bitcoin has predominantly become a tool for wealth preservation, adept at safeguarding value across time and space. As the
          inaugural digital monetary asset, Bitcoin catalysed numerous derivative assets,
          most of which served to underscore Bitcoin's inherent attributes before fading
          from prominence. Yet, this evolutionary process birthed two notable crypto-asset
          categories: Layer 1 Protocols and Decentralized Finance (DeFi).`,

      Smart Chain, function as global computational frameworks, enabling the
      deployment of diverse applications including financial contracts and
      decentralised organisations. These protocols, often referred to as "world
      computers," facilitate narrowly-defined program executions on a global scale.
      Their monetary premium is from accrueing value from usage fees, and their longevity is
      bolstered by growing user bases and application diversification.`,

      para: `DeFi, the second sustainable crypto-asset class, offers financial services for
          asset holders. Protocols in this domain, such as Uniswap, LIDO, AAVE, and
          THORChain, provide a range of services including asset swaps, savings products,
          and lending facilities. DeFi protocols generate revenue by capitalising on the
          Total Value Locked (TVL) within their systems. Emerging valuation methodologies
          for DeFi reflect their operational parallels with traditional financial
          entities, but with significantly reduced operational costs, highlighting their
          innovative edge in the financial landscape.`,
