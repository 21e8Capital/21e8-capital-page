    bullet1Title:'Bitcoin',
    bullet1Para:`Cryptocurrency, a novel financial asset class initiated by Bitcoin's trading debut on Mt. Gox in 2010, has evolved into a sophisticated economic ecosystem. Initially conceptualised as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, Bitcoin has predominantly become a tool for wealth preservation, adept at safeguarding value across time and space. As the
    inaugural digital monetary asset, Bitcoin catalysed numerous derivative assets,
    most of which served to underscore Bitcoin's inherent attributes before fading
    from prominence. Yet, this evolutionary process birthed two notable crypto-asset
    categories: Layer 1 Protocols and Decentralized Finance (DeFi).`,
    bullet1URL:'https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin',

    bullet2Title:'Layer 1',
    bullet2Para:`Layer 1 Protocols, epitomised by platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance
    Smart Chain, function as global computational frameworks, enabling the
    deployment of diverse applications including financial contracts and
    decentralised organisations. These protocols, often referred to as "world
    computers," facilitate narrowly-defined program executions on a global scale.
    Their monetary premium is from accrueing value from usage fees, and their longevity is
    bolstered by growing user bases and application diversification.`,
    bullet2URL:'https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/layer-1',

    bullet3Title:'DeFi',
    bullet3Para:`DeFi, the second sustainable crypto-asset class, offers financial services for
    asset holders. Protocols in this domain, such as Uniswap, LIDO, AAVE, and
    THORChain, provide a range of services including asset swaps, savings products,
    and lending facilities. DeFi protocols generate revenue by capitalising on the
    Total Value Locked (TVL) within their systems. Emerging valuation methodologies
    for DeFi reflect their operational parallels with traditional financial
    entities, but with significantly reduced operational costs, highlighting their
    innovative edge in the financial landscape.`,

    bullet2Title:'Strict Scarcity:',
    bullet2Para:'Bitcoin has a hard cap on its supply, unlike gold or fiat currencies. This fixed supply makes it an unparalleled monetary asset.',

    bullet3Title:'Censorship Resistance:',
    bullet3Para:'Bitcoin allows for uncensored transactions and can be transferred globally with a memorized passphrase, unlike fiat currencies that can be heavily regulated.',

    bullet4Title:'Global Accessibility:',
